# Snippetbox

This application was developed by following the [Creating a web application in Go](https://golangify.com/go/web-app-go).

It's a full-stack Go web application called Snippetbox that lets people paste and share snippets of text â€” a bit like GitHub's Gists or Pastebin.

## Features

- Save and view snippets.
- Middleware.

## Development

Software requirements:

$ make cert

$ make dev
```

To run the tests, run `make test`.
For more info, run `go run .\cmd\web -help`
